 * To check the examples go to cd ~/.npm/nodemw/0.3.14/package/examples.  
 * To see the content of a Wikipedia page run: ```node retrieve-page.njs zh å±±``` (set language and page name accordingly).  
 * To retrieve a list of categories and relevant pages run: ```node retrieve-cats.njs en 0.cats``` where en is the language and 0.cats is a file with initial list of pages and categories.  This will produce a new file 1.cats (or higher number) with a list of pages and categories retrieved based on the original list.
 * To get edits stats run ```node retrieve-edit-stats.njs en 0.cats```.

All files are tab-delimited.
